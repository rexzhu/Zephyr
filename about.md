### Freshman is a simple Jekyll theme.

Freshman is the first Jekyll theme I have maded for a long time, however I never use it.
I publish it today (20141216), for the people who want to made their simple theme themselves. You can find the source code at [github](https://github.com/yulijia/freshman/).

I already made another Jekyll theme [Freshman21](https://github.com/yulijia/freshman21/), this theme is what I am using now.


<cite>Proudly enjoy using Freshman theme.</cite> <code>;)</code>
